==========

This is a simple theme created by Michael J. Ross (http://www.ross.ws/) for the DrupalCamp Las Vegas 2012, based on the Drupal 6 "basic" starter theme.

Consequently, this theme has six built-in regions, aside from the default content region: header, content top, content bottom, footer, first sidebar, and second sidebar. 

The header image was created by Wendy Minatogawa, using artwork created by and licensed from Albert Campbell.

The logo, site name, and mission statement features have been disabled in the page template to prevent anyone from accidentally enabling them on the site and thereby injecting unwanted images or content in the header. The search box has not been enabled in the template, because arguably there is no good place in the header for search box. Instead, any search box could be placed in the sidebar.

The main navigation menu is not centered, under the header image, because at the time of development I did not know the number of menu items and their labels, and thus the space consumed by those menu items. But it looks fine starting from the left with the first menu item, and going as far to the right as needed.

Blocks in the 'Second sidebar' region work fine, but the 'First sidebar' region overlaps the center content area (probably because the second sidebar was widened to allow more content inside it), so it is not advisable to use the 'First sidebar' region.
